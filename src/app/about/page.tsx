          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Established in 1842 by the visionary Felix Tell, our agency has stood as a beacon of artistic excellence and human potential for over 180 years. What began as a small atelier in the heart of Europe has evolved into a sanctuary for emerging talent, while maintaining the timeless values of our founder.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Felix Tell believed that true beauty lies not in perfection, but in authenticity. In an era where artistic expression was often confined to the privileged few, he opened his doors to those with raw talent and genuine passion. This revolutionary approach, which once challenged the conventions of his time, remains at the core of our philosophy today.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
            In our modern age, we continue Felix Tell's legacy by embracing technology while preserving the human touch. We understand that the journey of a new talent begins in the comfort of their home, with a simple photograph that captures their essence. This intimate beginning is not a limitation, but rather a testament to the authentic nature of true potential.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
            To our cherished talents:

Our role is to nurture this raw potential, to guide you through the early stages of your career, and to ensure that your introduction to the world of modeling is both safe and dignified.
